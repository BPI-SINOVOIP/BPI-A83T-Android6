The NotificationManager can tell you how many notifications your application is currently showing.
This sample demonstrates how to use this API that has been introduced with Android M.
To get started, press the "add a notification" button.
When a notification is being canceled, the count gets updated via a PendingIntent.

             (e.g. services, basic styles and theming, sync adapters)

             (e.g. performance optimizations, custom views, bluetooth)

             Expert is reserved for highly technical or specialized content, and should
             be used sparingly. (e.g. VPN clients, SELinux, custom instrumentation runners) -->

            The NotificationManager can tell you how many notifications your application is
            currently showing. This sample demonstrates how to use this API that has been
            introduced with Android M.
         </description>
        <intro>
            The [NotificationManager][1] has become more powerful.
            Starting with Android M, you can query it for the active notifications that
            your app sent using the [notify][2] methods.

            This sample demonstrates simple use of this newly added functionality by
            allowing a user to add notifications and then querying how many notifications
            are currently being displayed via the [getActiveNotifications()][3] method.
