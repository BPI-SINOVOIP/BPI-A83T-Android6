            <![CDATA[
The Android MIDI API ([android.media.midi][1]) allows developers to connect a MIDI device to Android
and process MIDI signals coming from it. This sample demonstrates some basic features of the MIDI
API, such as enumeration of currently available devices (Information includes name, vendor,
capabilities, etc), notification when MIDI devices are plugged in or unplugged, and receiving MIDI
signals. This sample contains a simple implementation of oscillator and play sound for incoming MIDI
signals.
